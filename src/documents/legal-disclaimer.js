# Responsibility for Mnemonics(Paper Keys), Passwords and Catastrophic Impact of Their Loss

If you use this app to create a Wallet, the software will use an algorithm to generate a random 24-word phrase as a seed to a BIP32 hierarchical wallet. This 24-word phrase is called a mnemonic(paper key) and if reproduced exactly stores all the information needed to recover your Wallet if access through a password or other authentication means is lost or otherwise not available.

The author does not store, have access to, or have any way or means of recovering mnemonics(paper keys), passwords or private keys.

It is your responsibility to keep your mnemonic(paper key) secure. You should not provide it to anyone, including the author.

If you permanently forget or lose your mnemonic(paper key), you will NEVER be able to recover any cryptocurrency in your Wallet, and you will suffer a complete, irrecoverable and catastrophic loss of all Digital Assets in your Wallet.

It is your responsibility to safeguard and retain your mnemonic(paper key). The author has no responsibility and will not be liable for any loss or damage you suffer from the loss or misappropriation of your mnemonic(paper key).
